# Arduino and Math Combined Project: Dynamic System Modeling

## Project Description

This project focuses on building and analyzing a dynamic system using Arduino and mathematical principles. The goal is to create a working physical model that demonstrates real-time data acquisition, mathematical modeling, and interactive control. Examples of such systems include simulated environmental models, motion control devices, or data visualization tools.

By combining the capabilities of Arduino for sensing and control with mathematical concepts for analysis and prediction, this project provides a hands-on learning experience in:

* **Real-time Data Acquisition:** Utilizing sensors to gather data from the physical model.
* **Mathematical Modeling:** Applying mathematical formulas and algorithms to understand and predict the system's behavior.
* **Interactive Control:** Implementing control logic to manipulate the system based on sensor data and mathematical calculations.
* **Data Visualization:** Representing the collected and processed data in a meaningful way.

## Potential Project Examples

* **Simulated Environmental System:**
    * Modeling temperature gradients, fluid dynamics, or light intensity variations.
    * Using sensors to collect environmental data and Arduino to visualize and analyze it.
* **Motion Control Device:**
    * Building a robotic arm, a pendulum system, or a moving platform.
    * Applying kinematics, dynamics, and control theory to achieve precise motion.
* **Data Visualization Tool:**
    * Creating a device that visualizes sound frequencies, sensor data, or mathematical functions.
    * Using Arduino to process data and display it on an LCD, LED matrix, or computer screen.
